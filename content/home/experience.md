  I was a postdoc in project “Exact approximate Monte Carlo methods for complex Bayesian inference” funded by Academy of Finland (PI Dr. Matti Vihola). My main responsibilities were developing and implementing Bayesian inference algorithms which combine approximate marginal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using fast deterministic approximations and importance sampling type estimators based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for parallel and consistent MCMC especially for state space models.
