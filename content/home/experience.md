  I was a postdoc in project “Exact approximate Monte Carlo methods for complex Bayesian inference” funded by Academy of Finland (PI Dr. Matti Vihola). I developed and implemented Bayesian inference algorithms which combine approximate marginal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using fast deterministic approximations and importance sampling type estimators based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for parallel and consistent MCMC especially for state space models.

During my PhD studies I focused on time series analysis and related prediction problems, first under the classical ARIMA framework and then in more general state space modelling context. The major contribution of the [PhD thesis](https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/49043) was the development and implementation of [KFAS](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KFAS), an efficient R package for state space modelling of observations from exponential family.

I was a research assistant at the Department of Signal Processing, under the supervision of Professor Ioan Tabus in summer of 2010. My task was to develop a social sequence clustering methods based on hidden Markov models. I presented a paper [MDL based HMM clustering for life sequence analysis](http://sp.cs.tut.fi/WITMSE10/Proceedings/WITMSE2010_Papers/WITMSEHelskeEerolaTabus-1.pdf) at [Third Workshop on Information Theoretic Methods in Science and Engineering](http://sp.cs.tut.fi/WITMSE10/). While I pursued other things during my PhD, the idea of using HMMs for social sequence clustering lead to several other papers (see publications section).
  
  Key topics:
  * Hidden Markov Models
  * Clustering Methods
  * Social Sequence Analysis
  * Minimum Description Length
