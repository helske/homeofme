### __Project Grant__

- __Year:__ 2020-2024
- __Granting Agency:__ Academy of Finland
- __Project Title:__ Towards well-informed decisions: Predicting long-term effects of policy reforms on life trajectories
- __Project Abstract:__  In this project we will develop advanced statistical simulation tools that predict and show the impact of policy changes on individuals' life. An example would be how changes in parental leave policies affect work and family events, that in turn affect each other, and set the course for the life direction of the family as an entity and its interdependent individuals. These tools will allow for an improved understanding of the impact of policy reform on individuals' wellbeing. The starting point for this project will be the unique register data covering the full populations of Finland and Sweden. A careful analysis of these data will allow us to gain an understanding on the long-term impacts of parental leave reforms as well as guiding us in the development of the tool. We will use an approach known as "Bayesian" modelling, which allows us to combine previous knowledge, data, and statistical analysis in a coherent way.
