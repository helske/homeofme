description: "I am a Academy Research Fellow in Statistics at the University of Turku and a subconsortium-PI of the consortium project *Towards well-informed decisions: Predicting long-term effects of policy reforms on life trajectories* ([PREDLIFE](https://sites.utu.fi/predlife)) at University of Jyväskylä. 

My current research focuses on developing efficient and accurate Bayesian methods for estimating causal effects especially in the context of complex multivariate time series models (e.g, panel data). More broadly, my research interests are related to computational statistics, especially Bayesian time series models, causal inference, visualization of complex data and models, and statistical software development."
