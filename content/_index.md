description: "I am a senior researcher in Statistics at the University of Jyv채skyl채 and a subconsortium-PI of the Academy of Finland consortium project *Towards well-informed decisions: Predicting long-term effects of policy reforms on life trajectories* ([PREDLIFE](https://sites.utu.fi/predlife)). 

My current research focuses on developing efficient and accurate Bayesian methods for estimating causal effects especially in the context of complex multivariate time series models (e.g, panel data). More broadly, my research interests are related to computational statistics, especially Bayesian time series models, causal inference, visualization of complex data and models, and statistical software development."
