 abstract={Panel data are ubiquitous in scientific domains such as sociology and
  econometrics. Various modeling approaches have been presented for the
  causal inference based on such data, including Markov models, cross-lagged
  panel models, and their extensions. Existing panel data modeling
  approaches typically impose some restrictive assumptions on the
  data-generating process, such as Gaussian responses, effects that are
  constant in time, and ability to consider only short-term causal
  effects. With the goal of surmounting these restrictions, we present
  the dynamic multivariate panel model (DMPM) that supports
  time-varying, time-invariant, and individual-specific effects,
  multiple simultaneous responses across a wide variety of
  distributions, and arbitrary dependency structures of lagged responses
  of any order. We take a Bayesian approach and leverage
  state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for the estimation
  of the posterior distributions of the model parameters and causal
  effects of interest. We demonstrate the use of DMPM by applying the
  model to both real and synthetic data.}
