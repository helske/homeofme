## Abstract

In this article, a model-based method for clustering life sequences is suggested. In the social sciences, model-free clustering methods are often used in order to find typical life sequences. The suggested method, which is based on hidden Markov models, provides principled probabilistic ranking of candidate clusterings for choosing the best solution. After presenting the principle of the method and algorithm, the method is tested with real life data, where it finds eight descriptive clusters with clear probabilistic structures.
