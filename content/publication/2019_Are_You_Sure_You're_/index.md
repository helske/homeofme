abstract = "Common reporting styles of statistical results, such as confidence intervals (CI), are prone to dichotomous interpretations especially on null hypothesis testing frameworks, for example by claiming significant differences between drug treatment and placebo groups due to the non-overlapping CIs of the mean effects, while disregarding the magnitudes and absolute difference in the effect sizes. Techniques relying on the visual estimation of the strength of evidence have been recommended to limit such dichotomous interpretations but their effectiveness has been challenged. We ran two experiments to compare several visual representations of confidence intervals, and used a Bayesian multilevel model to estimate the effects of visualization on differences in subjective confidence of the results. Our results suggest that adding visual information to standard CI representation can decrease the sudden drop around p-value 0.05 compared to standard CIs and textual representation of CI with p-values.
