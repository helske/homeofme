  I did my Statistics studies in at the University of Jyväskylä, and after a postdoc under [Matti Vihola](http://users.jyu.fi/~mvihola/) (Bayesian Markov chain and sequential Monte Carlo stuff) I did my second postdoc at [Anders Ynnerman's](https://ynnerman.se/) Infovis group at the Linköping University (various visualization and statistic stuff), before coming back to Jyväskylä to work on causal inference with [Juha Karvanen](http://users.jyu.fi/~jutakarv/) as part of the  *Decision analytics utilizing causal models and multiobjective optimization* ([DEMO](https://www.jyu.fi/it/en/research/research-projects/academy-of-finland/demo)) project. I am now running my own Academy of Finland project [PREDLIFE](https://sites.utu.fi/predlife) (together with [Satu Helske](https://www.utu.fi/en/people/satu-helske)).
  
  My research can be broadly classified as computational statistics, mainly related to time series methods (state space models, hidden Markov models) and respective statistical software development. Check out my [publications](/publication) and [R packages](/software) for more details on my current and previous research interests. You can also take look at my [CV](/files/cv.pdf)
