I am a senior researcher in statistics at the University of Jyväskylä and a subconsortium-PI of the Academy of Finland consortium project *Towards well-informed decisions: Predicting long-term effects of policy reforms on life trajectories* ([PREDLIFE](https://sites.utu.fi/predlife)). I am also a part of the project *Decision analytics utilizing causal models and multiobjective optimization* ([DEMO](https://www.jyu.fi/it/en/research/research-projects/academy-of-finland/demo)). My current research focuses on developing efficient and accurate Bayesian methods for estimating causal effects especially in the context of complex time series models. More broadly, my research interests are related to computational statistics, especially Bayesian time series models, causal inference, visualization of complex data and models, and statistical software development.
